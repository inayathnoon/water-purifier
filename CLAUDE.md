# Water Purifier Service System — V1 Build

## What This System Does

A web application for a small water-purifier sales and service business (7 staff, trimmed to 5 seats for v1: 1 owner, 1 admin, 3 service techs). Replaces informal notebook tracking with a structured app that enforces the business's hard rules about payment, job assignment, and warranty coverage.

## Architecture

**Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes + Supabase serverless functions
- **Database**: Postgres (Supabase)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth (email + password, no self-signup)
- **Hosting**: Railway (Hobby tier, ~$5–8/mo)
- **Async jobs**: GitHub Actions cron → API routes
- **Group chat**: Telegram Bot API (free, outbound only)
- **Product sync**: Google Sheets API (nightly pull)

## Hard Rules (§13) — Enforced in Code

1. **Order cannot close while money is owed** → Postgres trigger + CHECK constraint on orders table
2. **Enquiry closure needs 30+ words & ≥1 prior call** → Server-side validation in `/api/admin/enquiries/close`
3. **No charge inside warranty year** → `charge_amount` computed from `installation_date` at write time
4. **Service staff never see price/discount/balance** → Supabase RLS policies + server-side field filters
5. **Jobs only assigned to service staff** → `CHECK` constraint on `tickets.assigned_to_id`

## Data Model

Four tables + enums:

### Enums
- `user_role`: `owner` | `admin` | `service_staff`
- `ticket_kind`: `enquiry` | `installation` | `service_visit`
- `ticket_status`: `open` | `booked` | `completed` | `closed` | `passed_to_owner` | `inactive`
- `half_day`: `morning` | `afternoon` | `evening`
- `location_type`: `home` | `office`
- `event_type`: `job_assigned` | `job_completed` | `leave_requested` | `payment_reminder`
- `notification_status`: `sent` | `failed` | `pending`

### Tables

**`users`** (1 row per staff member)
- `id` (UUID, refs auth.users)
- `email`, `role`, `name`

**`customers`** (phone number is the only lookup key, §4.1)
- `id`, `phone_number` (UNIQUE), `name`, `address`, `area`
- Trigger: uppercase name/address/area on write

**`tickets`** (one table for enquiry/installation/service_visit, §6)
- `id`, `customer_id`, `kind`, `status`, `assigned_to_id`
- Enquiry fields: `enquiry_product_interest`, `call_count`, `callback_date`, `closure_reason`, `closure_explanation`
- Installation/Service fields: `booked_date`, `booked_half_day`, `location`, `actual_date`, `actual_start_time`, `actual_end_time`, `actual_notes`
- Service fields: `parts_used`, `charge_amount`
- Warranty: `installation_date`, `warranty_expires_at`, `service_declined`
- Constraint: `assigned_to_id` must reference a `service_staff` user

**`orders`** (created only when installation ticket is closed, §7.1)
- `id`, `ticket_id` (UNIQUE), `list_price`, `sold_price`, `paid_amount`
- Computed: `discount = list_price - sold_price`, `balance_owed = sold_price - paid_amount`
- Trigger: refuse close if `balance_owed > 0`

**`products`** (synced from Google Sheets nightly)
- `id`, `code` (UNIQUE, immutable §9.4), `category`, `type`, `brand`, `name`, `list_price`, `active`
- Rows removed from sheet → `active = false` (never deleted, §9.3)

**`notifications_log`** (audit trail for Telegram/Webhook failures)
- `id`, `event_type`, `status`, `error_message`, `created_at`

## Row-Level Security (RLS)

- **Owners/Admins** see everything
- **Service staff** see only their own assigned tickets (cannot see prices, discounts, balances)
- **All authenticated users** can read customers and products

## Build Stages (Rollout to Live)

1. **Foundation** ✅ (in progress)
   - [x] Next.js + Tailwind + TypeScript scaffold
   - [x] Supabase schema (tables, enums, constraints, RLS)
   - [x] Auth scaffolding (Supabase Auth, login page, middleware)
   - [x] Dashboard home screen
   - [ ] Manual user account creation (run SQL scripts for the 5 initial users)

2. **Enquiry → Installation → Order loop** ✅ Complete
   - [x] Admin enquiry list, call logging, conversion (`/admin/enquiries`)
   - [x] Installation booking to service staff (`/admin/installations`)
   - [x] Tech completion workflow (`/staff/jobs` — minimal, full UX in Stage 3)
   - [x] Admin closing call + order creation (`/api/admin/tickets/[id]/close`)
   - [x] Payment tracking — 3-day call logging, order close gate (`/admin/orders`)
   - [ ] 7-day owner alert (needs Telegram/notification channel — Stage 6)
   - *Proves hard rules 1, 2, 5 — enforced in `lib/services/tickets.ts`, `lib/services/orders.ts`, and DB triggers*

   Schema correction made in this stage: the "can't close while owed" trigger
   from Stage 1 referenced columns that don't exist on `tickets` — fixed by
   giving `orders` its own `status` (open/closed) with `discount` and
   `balance_owed` as Postgres generated columns, plus a `call_log` table for
   §5.2 that Stage 1 had missed. See `supabase/migrations/001_init_schema.sql`.

3. **Service staff job view** ✅ Complete
   - [x] Today-only view by default, "+N upcoming" to expand (§15.2)
   - [x] Large touch targets, prefilled date/time, tap-to-call customer
   - [x] Service-visit completion accepts parts + charge, but §8.5 warranty
         rule still overrides whatever the tech enters
   - *Staff sees no prices or balances*

   **Bug found and fixed in this stage:** Stage 2's `completeJob()` did
   `select('*')` and returned the full ticket row — which for an
   installation includes `agreed_price` (the sale price), sent straight to
   the technician's browser. A direct §13.4 violation. Fixed by giving that
   function an explicit column whitelist that excludes `agreed_price`,
   instead of trusting `select('*')` anywhere on a staff-facing path. Also
   corrected the service-visit charge logic: §8.4 has the tech record the
   charge for a chargeable visit; §8.5 only means the *within-warranty*
   determination overrides them, not that they never enter an amount.

4. **Warranty & yearly service loop** ✅ Complete
   - [x] GitHub Actions cron (`.github/workflows/nightly-jobs.yml`, 02:00 UTC)
         hits `/api/jobs/yearly-service-check`, secret-protected via `CRON_SECRET`
   - [x] Auto-creates a `service_visit` ticket per installation whose
         warranty just expired, guarded by `parent_installation_id` so a
         installation is only ever followed up once
   - [x] Admin flow at `/admin/service-calls`: call → decline (§8.6) or book
         → tech completes → admin confirms & closes (reuses the same
         `bookJob`/`completeJob`/`closeTicketAfterConfirmation` as installations)
   - *Proves hard rule 3 — `charge_amount` is forced to 0 inside the
     warranty year regardless of what the tech enters*

   **Two more gaps found and fixed in this stage:**
   1. Nothing in Stage 2 ever stamped `installation_date`/`warranty_expires_at`
      on a closed installation — the warranty clock never actually started.
      Fixed in `closeTicketAfterConfirmation()`: now dated from the
      technician's recorded `actual_date` (§8.1 — "from the day it was
      fitted"), not the day admin got around to closing it.
   2. Needed a way to stop the nightly job recreating the same yearly-service
      ticket every night after the first trigger. Added
      `tickets.parent_installation_id` (self-referencing) rather than a
      separate boolean flag — one query answers "already handled?" and it
      doubles as ticket lineage for §4.3.

   Env additions: `CRON_SECRET` (generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`),
   plus a GitHub repo secret `APP_URL` pointing at the deployed app.

5. **Product sync from Google Sheets** (Stage 5)
   - [ ] Google Sheets API client (service account, read-only)
   - [ ] Nightly sync + "Sync now" button
   - [ ] Fail loudly on renamed columns (§9.6), not silently
   - [ ] Upsert by `code`, flag missing rows inactive

6. **Telegram feed & leave requests** (Stage 6)
   - [ ] Telegram Bot API integration
   - [ ] Three message templates: job assigned, job completed, leave requested
   - [ ] Post after DB commit, never before (fail-safe: caught errors logged, no rollback)
   - [ ] Deep links to app routes (require Supabase session, §10.4)
   - [ ] Leave approval workflow (owner only decides, §11.3)

7. **Dashboards** (Stage 7)
   - [ ] Admin morning screen (§15.1): new enquiries, confirmations due, service calls due, payments outstanding — one screen, no navigating
   - [ ] Owner dashboard (§15.3): what's happening today, revenue this month, who's busy
   - [ ] Tech availability calendar

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Each hard rule: write a test that tries to break it, confirm backend refuses
- [ ] End-to-end: enquiry → call logged → converted → installation booked → tech completes → admin closes → order balances → payment → Telegram posts exactly 3 message types
- [ ] §15 checks: Admin's screen shows all 4 categories; tech can mark job done in <1 min on phone; renaming a Sheet column breaks sync loudly
